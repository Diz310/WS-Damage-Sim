This is the script that I am using for the finisher simulations found in this spreadsheet right here:

Keep in mind that this is my very first python script, so there are probably things in there that can be improved.

All the different functions for finishers that I simulated can be found in the finishers.py file, because there are a lot and I couldn't think of another way of saving all of them without clogging up the main script.
